                    Women face unique obstacles in math contests. We know what it's like being the only girl in the room,
                    at contest after contest. It's isolating and demotivating. And because of this, we're missing out on
                    the incredible opportunities offered by math contests.

                    We're a nonprofit whose mission is to both provide high-quality, low-cost contest math classes for
                    ambitious girls as well as create a community of math girls, from all levels of success, age, and
                    experience, that can support each other on their math journey. We believe in the power of community
                    and of women to help each other succeed. We are a non-profit organization comprising current and
                    former competitors ranging from MOPpers, USAMO qualifiers, and more&mdash;both women and men.

                    In one sentence: a math summer camp, but virtual and during the school year. Our program is a mix of
                    both math and community-building, where you do a lot of math and also get to know some other wonderful
                    people while you're at it.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The core of the virtual program is a six-lesson math class. Our teachers are selected from the highest
                    levels of math contests. They bring the experience and knowledge students need to succeed with the
                    flexibility to design their own curriculum. Along with the class, Athemath also provides office hour
                    sessions where students can ask for help on their classes' homework or any other math questions.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Also included in our program are program-wide math events, community building events, a virtual lounge,
                    and relaxed get-to-know-you chats.

                    One 3-month course has a class fee of $90 and we offer
